Spec my node
============

A basic bdd framework to work with node so that I can learn a bit of javascript and node. 

To Install
==========
    npm Spec_My_Node

To Use
======
    run spec_my_node <file_name>
or
# Create specs in ./spec and then:
    run spec_my_node 

Todo
====

* Add package to npm
* Display results like rspec doc type
* Extra report results to own object and file
* Add some useful asserts and useful assertion messages
* If I do really well add some mocks
