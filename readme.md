Spec my node
============

A basic bdd framework to work with node so that I can learn a bit of javascript and node. 

To Use
======
    run bin/spec_my_node <file_name>

Todo
====

* Display results like rspec doc type
* Extra report results to own object and file
* Add multiple file support
* console command support
* Add some useful asserts and useful assertion messages
* If I do really well add some mocks
