============

A basic bdd framework to work with node so that I can learn a bit of javascript and node. 

To Use

    run bin/spec_my_node <file_name>
or
    run bin/spec_my_node

Todo
====

* Add package to npm
* Display results like rspec doc type
* Extra report results to own object and file
* Add some useful asserts and useful assertion messages
* If I do really well add some mocks
